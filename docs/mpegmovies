Generator outputs AVI files in two formats:

1. 24-bit raw uncompressed
2. jpeg compressed (so called M-JPEG)

Quicktime player is probably the best thing at playing these files, I've
had really poor results from Windows Media Player which usually just tells
you the file is unsupported.  Great.

If you are on Windows any avi to mpeg compressor will do the job (I got
one with my USB video capture jobby).

On linux you do this, which creates an mpeg with 256kbps sound and 2048kbps
variable bit-rate (VBR) video:

1. install the mjpegtools package
2. modify lav2wav.c to remove the bit rate check so that it will let you
   do 22050 sample rate.
3. lav2wav vid.avi >vid.wav
4. mp2enc -r 44100 -b 256 -o vid.mp2 <vid.wav
5. lav2yuv vid.avi | mpeg2enc -q 6 -r 24 -b 2048 -n n -o vid.m1v
6. mplex -V vid.mp2 vid.m1v -o vid.mpg

You may need to specify '+n' to lav2wav to specify NTSC normalisation, or
'+p' if you've recorded PAL.

These are the standard frame rates that mpeg 2 supports:
  24 (film), 25 (pal), 30 (ntsc), 50 (pal), 60 (ntsc)

If you try and use something else you may have problems - the mpegtools
do not support other framerates so you must set the frame skip to 1
(50/60 fps) or 2 (25/30 fps) in Generator.  If you use another avi to
mpeg program then it may support a different input to output framerate.
