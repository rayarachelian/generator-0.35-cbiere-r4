Generator supports Genecyst patch files.  The format is assumed to be:

aabbcc:ddee<space><space><space><space><description>\r\n

aabbcc is a 24 bit hex address to write to, and ddee is the 16 bit data to
write.  Four spaces separate this information from the description.

Each line is DOS-style ended with a CR, LF.  Generator will read in unix
LF-only line endings but will always write in DOS format to maintain
compatibility.
